todo:

Interestingness:
[ ] enemy AI
[ ] different moves for different enemies

New moves:
	[ ] precision (stat boost for next 2 turns)
	[ ] attack both
	[ ] heal both
	[ ] turn dead enemy into a potion
	[ ] poison (take damage every turn for a few turns)
	[ ] freeze\stun (skip a turn, and defence is lowered to zero.)
	[ ] detonate dead

Player death:
[ ] when a player dies, no longer show their controls (1 computer mode)
[ ] when a player dies, don't replace them? or replace them with an enemy who attacks the surviving player correctly! (currently you get an AI ally)
[ ] don't let enemies win potions by killing players! lol

UI:
[ ] easier to know what actions other people took, especially when they miss.
[ ] on one computer, make both players use the same target
[ ] remove the yellow border around the page, it's not functional.



dev:
	tidy up the code.

----

[ ] attack sounds
[ ] recolor images to fit the color scheme?
[ ] put static over whole screen or just images
