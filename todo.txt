todo:

Tidy up time:
[x] after choosing a new skill, the skill form should disappear immediately, not with a delay
[x] preload all images
[x] drain should be as easy to hit with as shooting (or you'd never use it)
[x] disable moves if you don't have enough energy to use them.
	- Because it makes a lot more sense.
	- Previously you could use the move, it would just be less effective.
	- not 100% sure I want this, but let's try it for a while.
[x] UI disables moves you can't use.
[ ] dead players don't get a UI any more
[ ] when both players die the game ends, pop up a "Game Over" message


Interestingness:
	[ ] enemy AI
		Attack living opponents
	[ ] different moves for different enemies

New moves:
	[ ] precision (stat boost for next 2 turns)
	[ ] attack both
	[ ] heal both
	[ ] turn dead enemy into a potion
	[ ] poison (take damage every turn for a few turns)
	[ ] freeze\stun (skip a turn, and defence is lowered to zero.)
	[ ] detonate dead
	[ ] protect

Player death:
	[ ] when a player dies, no longer show their controls (1 computer mode)
	[ ] when both players die, end the game.

UI:
	[ ] easier to know what actions other people took, especially when they miss.
	[ ] on one computer, make both players use the same target


dev:
	tidy up the code.

----

[ ] attack sounds
[ ] recolor images to fit the color scheme?
[ ] put static over whole screen or just images
